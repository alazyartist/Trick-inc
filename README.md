## Trick-Inc

Trick-Inc is a non-profit founded by Trickers that aims to uplift and enrich the lives of individuals through spreading the sport and art of Tricking. Creating opportunites for the members of the community that would allow them to focus on their passions and do their best work for society. Educating the public on the toolset that engaging with Tricking offers to the individual and how that extends beyond the domain of Tricking.

## Mission

Creating the environment and opportunities that will enrich the lives of individuals and allow them to be the best version of themselves in whatever they pursue.

Investing in and Developing Technologies to Enrich and Uplift the Movement Arts Communities

## Vision

To create a sustainable infrastructure for the Tricking Industry that would allow for individuals to make an impact through their work both in and outside of the Tricking culture.

## Values

### Tricking Comes First

All decisions should be made with the question in mind how does this affect Tricking? All decisions and projects should work towards the aim that it will spread an authentic version of the information and skills.

### For The Culture

All projects should aim to enrich and expand the Tricking culture in a way that gives proper creedence to the past. Understanding where the culture has been will inform where it will go. Encouraging a growth of the culture through different types of projects and exploring new avenues that will push Tricking forward.

### Empower Individuals

The world is created and run by individuals with Ideas and resources. Our aim is to uplift individuals into oportunities whre they can realize their ideas by connecting them with the Teams and resources they require for success.

### Collaboration

Competition is good as long as its healthy, but that should always be accompanied by a degree of collaboration. A desire to push the field forward by sharing information with competion that will benefit to the community. This reinforces our Tricking comes first and For the Culture tenants.

### Break the Rules

Encouraging projects that go counter to the “norm” of society. Trying to replace the consumerism with a communitas. Looking at the way things are currently run and trying to create a better version. Even if that means breaking the “rules” of that domain. (rules here being standards or “the way its always been”) . In short. “Do Better”
